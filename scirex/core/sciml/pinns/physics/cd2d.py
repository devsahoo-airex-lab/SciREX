"""Loss Function Implementation for 2D Convection-Diffusion Problem.

This module implements the loss function for solving 2D convection-diffusion 
equations using Physics Informed Neural Networks. It focuses on computing 
residuals of the PDE with known coefficients.


Key functions:
    - pde_loss_cd2d: Computes  PDE loss
